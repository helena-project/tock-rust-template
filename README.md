Template for creating Tock applications in Tock


## Getting Started

First steps:

1. Get a copy of the latest nightly, in this repo's root:

    `rustup install nightly`
    
    
    `rustup override set nightly`

    Your rustc should be at least this new:
    ```
    $ rustc --version
    rustc 1.21.0-nightly (7ac979d8c 2017-08-16)
    ```

2. Need to grab a copy of the rust sources:

    `rustup component add rust-src`

3. Now you should be able to build with:

    `make`

4. To upload code on to a board:

   `tockloader install`
